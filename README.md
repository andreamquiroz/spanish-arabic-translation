A high-quality neural machine translation system for translating Spanish text to Arabic, built using the MarianMT transformer architecture and optimized with advanced beam search techniques.

## Overview

This project implements a Spanishâ†’Arabic translation system by fine-tuning the MarianMT model on a parallel corpus combining UN documents and OpenSubtitles data. The system achieves a BLEU score of 27.06 on the test set, performing particularly well on formal and institutional text.

### Features
- Fine-tuned MarianMT model specifically for Spanish-to-Arabic translation
- Optimized beam search with width 5 for improved translation quality
- Easy-to-use translation scripts and evaluation tools
- Detailed analysis of model performance across different text types
- Comprehensive notebooks documenting the entire process
